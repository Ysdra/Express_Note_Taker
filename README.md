## App Description & User's Guide:
### If you are using this app on the Heroku web link: 
No extra actions are needed; you can immediately start taking notes!

### If you are using this app locally on your own machine:
1. Install node.js locally to your machine
2. Open a git bash terminal and enter the command "npm install" in order to install the necessary node dependencies 
3. Type into the same terminal "node server.js" to run the server.js on localhost:3000
4. Enter "localhost:3000" into the address bar of your preferred web browser

## Methodology:
This Node.js application leverages the express node modules in order to dynamically populate notes for the end-user. The live application is hosted on a Heroku server and lacks any backend database to store persisting data (note: this means that any notes saved will be automatically deleted).
